        'Crowded teeth happen when the jaw does not have enough space to accommodate all the teeth properly. This leads to overlapping, twisting, or displacement of teeth, affecting both appearance and oral hygiene.',

    causes: [
      'Genetics – Inherited jaw size or tooth size that causes imbalance.',
      'Tooth size-jaw mismatch – Larger teeth in a small jaw can lead to crowding.',
      'Early loss of baby teeth – Leads to shifting of permanent teeth into improper positions.',
      'Delayed eruption – Can cause nearby teeth to occupy space meant for others.',
      'Thumb sucking or tongue thrusting – May influence the alignment of developing teeth.',

    symptoms: [
      'Overlapping or twisted teeth.',
      'Difficulty brushing or flossing due to tight spaces.',
